## Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models

### Data

Audio samples can be found here: [online demo](https://lingjzhu.github.io/TTS_and_Tone_demo/)

All synthesized stimuli can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AX0jqPnigC2s2CSuDbWhNwVRwcFg8dmM?usp=sharing).


### Demo
2. Download pre-trained Mandarin models at this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sf9t4IzMVGAgcznoTIn2mRNlcVkZuE3w?usp=sharing).
3. Download [pre-trained Chinese BERT](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm) (`BERT-wwm-ext, Chinese`).
